# Airbnb front-end

## The idea is to get different csvs of Airbnb, create an import and build a website around it

What is currently working
- user registration
- user login
- user logout
- show paginated room inside city pages
- show single room page

What will be added in the next future:
- possibility to owners to claim their room and add more data
- phone verification on owner registration
- cache pagination count in Redis
- add amenities pages and show paginated relative rooms
- build more cvs imports from different sources
- gather more info for each room
- apply a better design (I'm defenetely not a designer :D )
